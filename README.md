Digital Rail is an interlocking system for model railways. It aims to be as
realistic as possible and is based on the German railway system. It is written
in Java and Python and is designed to be used on a Raspberry Pi (Zero).

Basis of the interlocking is a graph using
an [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list). By using
the [depth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
algorithm, the interlocking is able to determine all possible paths in the
graph. Not every path makes logically sense for a train, so we need to filter
them out. Keep in mind that if there are several paths between two nodes, the
interlocking will only use the first one it finds. This will be solved in the
future.

## State of Development

- üößInterlocking
    - ‚úÖFind all paths (Spurplan)
    - ‚úÖDetermine indication/position of signals/switches on a path
    - ‚úÖLock all elements on a path and transmit the indication/position of
      signals/switches to the concentrator
    - ‚úÖRelease single elements on a path
    - ‚õîFind the best path (currently: first path)
    - ‚õîÔ∏èProvide flank protection (Flankenschutz)
    - ‚õîAllocate elements in specific order (switches -> flank protective
      signals -> signals)
    - ‚õîÔ∏èCommunication between interlocking systems
- üößTrack Field Concentrator (Gleisfeldkonzentrator, GFK)
- üößCLI
- ‚õîÔ∏èUI
- ‚õîÔ∏èDecoders
- ‚õîÔ∏èTrack vacancy detection system (Gleisfreimeldeanlage)
- ‚õîDocumentation (I'm so sorry ...)

## Current look and feel

Right now, I have implemented a simple track graph on a breadboard using LEDs
both for signals and switches. As I want to cover motors for the switches at a
later point, I have used a relay to simulate the motor. If the switch should
point to its alternate position, the blue LED is on. If the switch should point
to its base position, the red LED is off. The image below shows my setup:

The above state can be achieved by typing `A.P2` into the CLI. The track graph
looks like this:

## Usage

### Build and run concentrator

```shell
cd digital-rail-concentrator
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel
python setup.py bdist_wheel build
# After transferring the .whl file to the pi:
python -m pip install digital_rail_concentrator-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
rail-concentrator
```

### Build and run interlocking

```shell
mvn clean package
export INTERLOCKING_DOCUMENT_PATH=./examples/document.json
export INTERLOCKING_SOCKET_SERVER_IP=<ip or hostname>
java -jar digital-rail-interlocking/target/digital-rail-interlocking-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Run CLI

```shell
java -jar digital-rail-cli/target/digital-rail-cli-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

## Architecture

### Real World Architecture

The goal is to create a topology inspired
by [Digitale Schiene Deutschland (digital rail Germany)](https://digitale-schiene-deutschland.de/en).
This would result in the following architecture:

```mermaid

    UI -- Ethernet --- Interlocking
    Interlocking -- Ethernet --- Concentrator1[Field Track Concentrator]
    Concentrator1 --- Element1[Track Element]
    Element1 --- Element2[Track Element]
    Element2 --- Element3[Track Element]
    Element3 -- Ethernet --- Concentrator1
    Interlocking -- Ethernet --- Concentrator2[Field Track Concentrator]
    Interlocking -- Ethernet --- Concentrator3[...]
```

### Current Architecture

The current architecture is a bit different, as the project is under
development.
The following diagram shows the current architecture:

```
